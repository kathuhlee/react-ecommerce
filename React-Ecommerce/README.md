Capstone 1

Your task is to build a website for the business of your choice. It can be for a grocery store, a car dealership, a jewelry shop, a cell phone store, a bookstore, or any other legitimate business that maintains an inventory and sells products. One limitation is that the business should not contain any content that is potentially ethically offensive or graphic (drugs, sexual content, etc.). Take some time to plan out your strategy for completing this project. As the saying goes, "If you fail to plan, you plan to fail."

The App must be a Single Page Application (SPA) created using the React.js and React Router libraries. As part of your planning/design process, you may want to investigate some UX design tools, otherwise
known as

"wireframing" tools. A few examples are:

Figma Sketch Balsamiq Omni Graffle Mockplus Adobe XD

It is highly recommended to design your application first, before starting to code, creating user stories, etc. This doesn’t have to perfectly match your final product but should reflect how you thought through how to fit all the pieces together. If you end up completely redesigning your project, your planning documents should reflect your new design.

You must also include this design in your pull request in a small, self-contained way (e.g.: no links to an online site, unless it doesn’t require the reviewer to sign in; no files/images/screenshots over 2MB).
